            <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or 
                XML. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on a webpage, including aspects such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. 
                It allows web developers to separate the structure of a document from its visual presentation, providing greater flexibility 
                and consistency across different devices. For example, imagine two separate web pages with identical HTML structure but different 
                CSS styles. One might have a modern, minimalist design, while the other adopts a classic, ornate aesthetic. The CSS examples 
                demonstrate the significant impact of styling on the overall look and feel of a website. </p>
            <p>ECMAScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language specification that serves as the foundation for several programming 
                languages, with JavaScript being the most widely known implementation. ECMAScript defines the core features that a scripting 
                language should provide, and JavaScript uses these features to enable dynamic, client-side behavior in web applications. 
                An example showcasing ECMAScript is the popular Wordle game. In this context, ECMAScript is utilized to create interactive and 
                dynamic elements, such as handling user input for guessing words, updating the display based on correct or incorrect guesses, and 
                managing the game's logic. The Wordle game example highlights how ECMAScript enhances user engagement and interactivity in web 
                applications.</p>

                    The first web page in this context provides an introduction to the concept of cloud computing. Cloud computing is a transformative 
                    technology that involves the delivery of computing services—such as storage, processing power, and applications—over the internet. 
                    This web page aims to offer a comprehensive overview of cloud computing, explaining its fundamental principles, benefits, and 
                    various deployment models. Users visiting this page will gain insights into how cloud computing has revolutionized the way 
                    organizations and individuals access and manage computing resources, fostering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency. 
                    The content may touch upon key components of cloud computing, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service 
                    (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), to provide a well-rounded understanding of this essential technology.
